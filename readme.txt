Restrict media library access based on user roles.

== Description ==

Media Restriction is a lightweight and powerful WordPress plugin that gives site admins full control over media library visibility. Easily restrict access to media files based on user roles, while selectively allowing individual users to bypass these restrictions.

Perfect for multi-author blogs, online course platforms, membership sites, and client-based projects ‚Äî this plugin ensures that users can only access their own uploads, reducing clutter, confusion, and potential privacy risks.

Whether you're using default WordPress roles or custom roles created by LMS, membership, or e-commerce plugins ‚Äî Media Restriction works seamlessly across your site.
